# 🧑‍💻 Approach

&nbsp; The project was made thinking that it will be used by a team manager, so it will list the users and the company where it works, which I think were the mainly data that the client will want to see. The other information can be accessed by pressing the user card.

# 🗃️ Folder Structure

```
.
└── src/
    ├── 📦️ components
    ├── 🔍️ navigation
    ├── 📱 screens
    ├── 💡 services
    └── 💄 styles
```

<br>

## 📦️ Components

&nbsp; This folder is self explanatory, is where all the components of the project are stored.

&nbsp; I could group even more the components in its own sections, but it is a small project, so I don't think it is that necessary. The creation of folders for every component is unnecessary, but I think it is useful to maintain the project readable.

<br>

## 🔍️ Navigation

&nbsp; The navigation folder store the configurations for the react-native-navigation package.

<br>

## 📱 Screens

&nbsp; The files on this folder are the views of the app. I didn't create a folder for every view because I don't think it will be views enough to make the screens folder unreadable.

<br>

## 💡 Services

&nbsp; Here I stored the graphql logic. This was mainly my problem with graphql, I didn't know well where to store it, so this was my better idea.

<br>

## 💄 Styles

&nbsp; This folder stores the global styles of the app, for the purpose of avoiding style redefinitions.
